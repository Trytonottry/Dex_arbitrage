Dex Arbitrage
This repository contains a decentralized exchange (DEX) arbitrage bot designed to identify and execute profitable trading opportunities across multiple DEXs on Ethereum, such as Uniswap and Sushiswap. The bot leverages real-time price monitoring and smart contracts to exploit price discrepancies, with support for flash loans to maximize returns. It is built for educational purposes and serves as a practical example for developers exploring DeFi arbitrage.
Features

Price Monitoring: Continuously tracks asset prices across specified DEXs to identify arbitrage opportunities.
Flash Loans: Utilizes flash loans (e.g., from dYdX) to execute trades without requiring upfront capital, reverting if unprofitable.
Smart Contracts: Implements arbitrage logic in Solidity, interacting with Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap router interfaces.
Automated Trading: Executes trades automatically when profitable opportunities are detected, accounting for gas fees and slippage.
Configurable: Supports customization of trading pairs, DEXs, and arbitrage parameters via configuration files.

Prerequisites

Node.js and npm for JavaScript dependencies
Truffle Framework for smart contract development
MetaMask browser extension for wallet integration
Ganache (optional) for local blockchain testing
Infura account (optional) for testnet/mainnet access
Python 3.6+ and pip for Python dependencies
An Ethereum account with ETH for gas fees

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Trytonottry/Dex_arbitrage.git
cd Dex_arbitrage


Install Node.js dependencies:npm install


Install Truffle globally (if not already installed):npm install -g truffle


Install Python dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

Required packages:
web3
requests


(Optional) Start a local blockchain with Ganache:ganache-cli


(Optional) Configure Infura for testnet/mainnet in truffle-config.js:module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*"
    },
    testnet: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY"),
      network_id: 4
    }
  }
};


Set up environment variables:
Copy .env-example.txt to .env and update with your Ethereum account details:cp .env-example.txt .env

Edit .env to include:ADDRESS=your_ethereum_address
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_KEY=your_infura_api_key





Usage

Compile and deploy the smart contracts:truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development

Update config/ethereum.json with the deployed contract address.
Run the arbitrage bot:python bot.py

The bot will monitor DEXs and execute trades when profitable opportunities are found.
(Optional) Test on a mainnet fork:npx hardhat node --fork https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY
npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/deploy.js


Recover funds (if needed):npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/recover.js


Interact with the bot via HTTP endpoints (if Flask server is enabled):
GET /opportunities: List current arbitrage opportunities.
POST /trade: Execute a specific trade. Example payload:{
  "dex1": "uniswap",
  "dex2": "sushiswap",
  "token": "0x...",
  "amount": 1.0
}





Project Structure

bot.py: Main Python script for running the arbitrage bot, handling price monitoring and trade execution.
contracts/: Solidity smart contracts for arbitrage logic and DEX interactions.
migrations/: Truffle migration scripts for contract deployment.
scripts/: Hardhat scripts for deployment and fund recovery.
config/: Configuration files (e.g., ethereum.json for contract addresses).
requirements.txt: Python dependencies.
truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration for network settings.

How It Works

Price Monitoring: The bot queries DEXs (via Web3.py) for real-time price data, comparing token prices across Uniswap, Sushiswap, and other supported exchanges.
Arbitrage Detection: Identifies price discrepancies where an asset can be bought on one DEX and sold on another for a profit, factoring in gas fees and slippage.
Flash Loans: Uses dYdX flash loans to borrow funds within a single transaction, executing trades and repaying the loan if profitable, or reverting if not.
Smart Contracts: The Solidity contract handles trade execution, interacting with DEX routers to swap tokens and calculate profits.
Risk Management: Includes slippage protection and gas optimization to minimize losses.
